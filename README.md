## Competition list

5. 

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

```sh
$ npm install --global standard-readme-spec
```

## Usage

This is only a documentation package. You can print out [spec.md](spec.md) to your console:

```sh
$ standard-readme-spec
# Prints out the standard-readme spec
```

### Generator

To use the generator, look at [generator-standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/generator-standard-readme). There is a global executable to run the generator in that package, aliased as `standard-readme`.

## Badge

If your README is compliant with Standard-Readme and you're on GitHub, it would be great if you could add the badge. This allows people to link back to this Spec, and helps adoption of the README. The badge is **not required**.
